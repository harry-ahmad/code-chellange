# Code Chellange

**Szenario:**
Imagine your friend - the owner of a small book shop - asks you for a simple representation of his latest sales.
He provides you a simple plain json export file.

**What you need to do?:**

- Design a database scheme for optimized storage
- Read the json data and save it to the database using php
- Create a simple page with filters for customer, product and price
- Output the filtered results in a table below the filters
- Add a last row for the total price of all filtered entries

**Additional information:**

- The shop system changed the timezone of the sales date.
- Prior to version 1.0.17+60 it was Europe/Berlin.
- Create a simple page with filters for customer, product and price
- Afterwards it is UTC. Please provide a tested class for the version comparison.
